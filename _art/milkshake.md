alt: An orange tabby cat in a traveling hood is sitting on the bar with a milkshake in front of him. His expression is one of betrayal and dissatisfaction. Something’s wrong with his special dessert. It doesn’t have a straw! Now everyone in the bar is looking at him. Beside the cat is a woman in a cape and a garish hat with a feather in it. She’s drinking coffee and looking mortified. Yes, this is her cat making a fuss. At the far end of the bar a lizard person looks on with curiosity. The background is dark and contains the suggestion of other people in the tavern.
