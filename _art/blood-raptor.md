alt: A digital painting in a red palette. In a forest clearing, the giant blood raptor lands. The bard’s fingers leap to the strings. A soothing song will calm this wild beast! The pirate charges in with his shovel held high. He’ll save her! Bards are too squishy to be on the front line like this. Meanwhile, the cat pokes his head up at the very bottom of the frame, looking out toward the viewer. He’d prefer not to be in this painting at all.
caption: FREEZE FRAME. Zeek looks straight at the camera. “You’re probably wondering how I got here…” -or- “LET MEOWT!”
cast: [ ash, gryphon, zeek ]
