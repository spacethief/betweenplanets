alt: A woman plays an instrument that looks like a cross between a lute and a guitar. She has on a wide-brimmed hat with a feather in it. Sheâ€™s sitting on a rock. The cat is hiding behind her. In the foreground, a bear watches her. Is it charmed by her song, or preparing to strike? Behind them is a dark forest with some mysterious lights glowing through the trees. The stars are out, and both the moons are full.
caption: Is a bard a witch? Well, she weaves a spell with her instrument, and nothing is more natural than music, right?
