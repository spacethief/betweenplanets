alt: A wizard with stars on his robe and moons on his hat is standing in front of a bookshelf. He’s pointing at an orange cat with a little cape on, who has his back turned and is staring out the window at some birds. The sun is setting over a distant forest. A telescope has fallen over, and there’s glass everywhere. In the foreground, a woman with a braid and a purple cape is sweeping up the mess with a long-handled broom.
caption: Cat broke a bunch of stuff again. He doesn’t seem to care at all, does he? Just sitting there, watching the birds. Truth is, he feels really bad about it, but he’s dissociating. He’ll offer his apologies later in the form of sitting on your chest and purring while you’re trying to read.
