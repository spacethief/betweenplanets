alt: A pirate digs in the garden while the cat watches intently. The bard sits off to the side, watching and playing some tunes. In the background, a shack leans dangerously to the side, soon to collapse. The roof has been overtaken by kudzu. Farther away, there are crooked trees reaching for the light.
