## About

‘The heck is this?’ you find yourself asking as you peruse this website. Well, friend, that’s a complicated question. You see, this got started a long, long time ago, when a daydreaming kid would wander to another world, full of strange and interesting people and creatures. A world full of magic.

Those daydreams became stories, and over time, the world grew, and that kid grew up. That grown-up kid looked at those old stories, and said, no, that’s not right. Let me start over. And so it went, starting over, not being good enough, and all of the life that happened in-between. That grown-up kid grew up a lot more in that time. But with growing up came lots of perspective about life, and what’s important.

Decades passed, and that adult looked at those old stories, and said, no, that’s not right. Let me start over. But this time, the story was good enough, and the writer was ready to tell it. So here we go, once more from the top.

Hi, I’m Ben. Welcome to my world.
